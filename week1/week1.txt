Difference between React and ReactDom

React : it is main core library of the React

ReactDom : only for the web to do DOM manipulation.

Async : in async what happens is while html parsing the same time fetching of scripts also happens. Once the script is fetched, html parsing 
is stopped and script is executed and html parsing continues.

When should we use async:

1. async shouldn't be used when there's a dependency between the scripts. because it doesn't care about the order, once the script is loaded
it executes therefor if there's a dependency we shouldn't use async.
2. async should be used only when fetching when there's no dependency

Defer : in defer html parsing will be finished completely, then the scripts which is being loaded will be executed one by one.

defer is used where there's a dependency between the script because it maintains the order
